The problem is... 1 app, for too many clients. Clients like custom templates. 

Q: How to solve (easily) ?
A: Create a TT macro that verifies if template exists in 2 places, with the following order:
*** The verification must happen everytime i PROCESS/INCLUDE something.. 

- /myapp/templates/mystore.com      <=- check here first, try to find a custom template
- /myapp/templates/default          <=- check here afterwards (if none custom template has been found)
** so it will always check 2 dirs... the current store and the default one.

So how it works? 
- my wrapper.tt:
    [% PROCESS "macros.tt2" %]
    [% find_tpl( template.name ); PROCESS $c.stash.tpl_found %]

- the templates:
    [% find_tpl( 'contato/telefones.tt' ); PROCESS $c.stash.tpl_found %]
